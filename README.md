# tamagotchi-mini-project

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Developer:
I'm Charlotte, originally from Paris. After eyeing the tech industry for a few years, I finally took the leap and decided to acquire the skillset needed to be a developer. I'm excited to see what I'm able to built, and this is one of my many first steps to come!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Game:
The point of the game is to keep your tamagotchi satisfied (preventing hunger/sleepiness/boredom from reaching 10).
If you do not, you die and the game stops.

How to Play:
• Use the buttons at the bottom of the screen to satisfy your tamagotchi.
• You cannot eat or play with your tamagotchi while it is asleep in its cave!
• When tamagotchi's stats reach critical levels, he will ask you to satisfy him.
• If you manage to keep your tamagotchi satisfied long enough, you will see him morph!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coming soon:
• Increased difficulty with higher morphing stages
• Tamago will be able to birth baby Tamagos, but you'll have to satisfy them too!
• Tamago will have a stamina stat that you will be able to level (will affect certain properties --> reduce briefly the need for sleep/play --> increase need for food)
• Tamago will be able to eat its young and absorb their abilities (but will become weakened, stats will rise faster and Tamago will be harder to satisfy).
